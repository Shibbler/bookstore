for publisher:
publisher_id->name,publisher_id

(because a book may have multiple publishers)
for published:
publisher_id,isbn->publisher_id,isbn

for author:
author_id->name,author_id

(book can have many authors)
for wrote:
author_id,isbn->author_id,isbn

(books can be similar, two books may be similar but without their isbn)
for book:
isbn->title,genre,price,stock,num_pages,pub_cut,isbn

(both are needed to imply ONE specific object)
for order_object:
order_id,isbn->quantity,order_id,isbn

because a user can order to different locations based on their order
(that is to say a user can order to someplace that is not their stored
location information), the user_id cannot imply this information, it's conditional to each order
user_order:
order_id->current_house_number,current_street,current_city,current_province,
current_postal_code,shipping_house_number,shipping_street,shipping_city,shipping_province,
shipping_postal_code,billing_house_number,billing_street,billing_city,billing_province,billing_postal_code,user_id,order_id,order_date

user_account:
user_id->name,shipping_house_number,shipping_street,shipping_city,shipping_province,shipping_postal_code,billing_house_number,billing_street,
billing_city,billing_province,billing_postal_code,user_id

TA confirmed we only need to show FD's within table, not cross table.

FOR 3NF EXPLANATION:
Must explain why order_object, published and wrote
have 2 attributes as primary key

All the others are 1 attribute primary keys with no
transitive functional dependencies

Proving 3NF:
for publisher:
FD publisher_id->name,publisher_id satisfies the condition \alpha is a superkey of F (where F is set of all FD's in publisher)
